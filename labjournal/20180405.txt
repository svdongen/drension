REPORT OF 5 APRIL 2018

> What did we do
- Made droplet video of ethanol, ethylene glycol, and water 
- Determine Vd, B0, R0, surface tension and Wo based on neelde width (NW), g and densisty difference. Calculated parameters do not seem to be completely accurate

> ToDos
- Measure droplet containing pectin and lysozyme at different lysozyme concentrations to find optimal lag time for change in surface tension
- Make droplet video of diethylene glycol and propylene carbonate
- Measure surface tension using a wilhelmy plate
- Find correct parameters by making droplet videos with higher resolution and use less slices in the fitting process

> Ideas
- Flow behaviour and elasticity
- Arduino/RaPI system
- Measure surface tension of gelatin droplet while solidifying and try to relate surface tension to temperature
- Find the effect of a surfactant on surface tension of an oscillating droplet
- Use magnetic nanoparticles and a magnet to alter surface tension
