Theory about the relation between surface tension and the adsorption of proteins (ovalbumin in our case) to the air/water
interface:
We propose that the apparend (measured) surface tension can be decribed as the weighted average of 2 surface tensions,
the surface tension of air/water and of air/protein (Similar idea to the Cassie-Baxter relation for the contact angle on
heterogeneous surfaces). As the absorbed amount of protein changes over time, we expect thesurface tension to shift from
the surface tension of water/air, to the surface tension of protein/air. However, due tointeractions between molecules,
it is difficult to predict/calculate the surface coverage of the protein. To make matters even more difficult, we did not
yet consider the denaturation of proteins on the surface (and the influence on the protein/air surface tension).

The adsorption of proteins on surfaces is a long studied subject, as papers can be found as early as 1939 (Langmuir et al.)
However, during most studies, asumptions were made which do (most likely) not hold for drop tensiometry. In most studies,
it is assumed that the surface is a perfect sink and all proteins stick to the surface (with infinitely large Ka) and never
come loose (infinitesimally small Kd). However, during drop tensiometry the available surface area is limited and the
adsorption of a protein will hinder the adsorption of the next (non-infinite Ka). Also, in other studies, linear (1d) diffusion
is assumed, as the proteins will diffuse from the bulk solution to the surface (top of the beaker) due to the concentration
gradient caused by the adsorption of proteins to the surface. However, during drop tensiometry, we have to take into account
the 3D-radial diffusion. This means that most (if not all) equations based on linear diffusion cannot be used for this system
