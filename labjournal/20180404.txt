REPORT OF 4 APRIL 2018

> What did we do
- Fitting image to Young-Laplace model to find Bond number
- Remove droplet finding code, now we locate the droplet manually as it should be the same for each picture which is faster

> ToDos
- Find droplet volume, surface tension and Wortington number from image
- Find a suitable surfactant to measure its effect on surface tension

> Ideas
- Flow behaviour and elasticity
- Arduino/RaPI system
- Measure surface tension of gelatin droplet while solidifying and try to relate surface tension to temperature
- Find the effect of a surfactant on surface tension of an oscillating droplet
