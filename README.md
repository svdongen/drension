# Drension

Drension is a software package for the extraction of parameters such as surface tension from pictures of droplets taken by modern smartphones or other photographic equipment.

## Getting Started

The software is written in Matlab (R2016b). Please make sure you have that installed and working.
The source code for the software is in the `src` directory.

Other folders contain the following information:
* `3d-printing`: 3D model of the set-up
* `calibration`: Analysis results of verification videos (water, ethylene glycol and ethanol) and exported graphs
* `droplet-results`: Analysis results of droplets with ovalbumin
* `excel`: Excel files with data, analyses and graphs
* `labjournal`: The labjournal can be found in `01. Labjournal.docx` or the corresponding `pdf` file. Photographs and notes are also present in this folder.
* `movies`: Movies of droplets. Please also read the "Big Data Files" section of this Readme.
* `photos`: Other photos obtained during the research.
* `poster`: Files used to create the poster presented at the Physical Chemistry and Soft Matter group (Wageningen) on 26 April 2018.
* `process-cartoon`: Images used to create a cartoon yielding a visual abstract of the methodology.
